## 3D Printer Model Instructions
- All of the Gcode are sliced for a Prusa MK3s+ printer with a .4mm nozzle and stacked layers at .15 mm
- .3mf files are included if you choose to do your own slicing for your specific 3D printer or application
- .gcodes are included for both PLA and PETG filament types, specifically for the Prusa 3D Printer
- .dfx CAD files are included for the fabrication of the case window, so the LCD is visible
- Any printer with a .4mm nozzle that uses 1.75mm filament shall work as long as it can accommodate .15mm tall layers
- The window should be a .125” thick Lexan or other polycarbonate. The minimum hole size is .125”, so many of the on-line services can create the windows.
- All hardware is 20mm M2.5.  You’ll need 6 per chassis to put the chassis together, and two 8mm to hold in the window on the left side. The M2.5 nylon cap nuts should be used.
