# [UAS 6.0 First Responder UAS Wireless Data Gatherer Challenge](https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/open-innovation-prize-challenges/current-and-upcoming-prize-challenges/2024-first-responder)

## Scope
This repository contains the IoT-Client or "Sensor Module" reference software for the NIST-PSCR UAS6.0: First Responder UAS Data Gatherer Challenge "**Fox Hunt**" Stage 2 & 3 events. These IoT nodes/Sensor Modules will be referred to herein as "Fox-Node(s)".

**Stage 2**: Sensor Module addition to the [Guidance for Stage 2](https://firstresponderuas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/UAS-6.0_Guidance-for-Stage-2-2024-0822.pdf) document. See document for further information.

**Stage 3**: 
UAS prize challenge competitors will participate in an in-person event to perform NIST-standardized tests and collect data from nodes scattered throughout the competition theater. 

## Fox-Node Solution Components
**Hardware**: 
- ESP32-S2 ([Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s2-tft-feather/overview))
- [Battery pack](https://www.ravpower.com/products/ravpower-10000mah-power-bank-dual-outputs?_pos=1&_psq=prime+1000&_ss=e&_v=1.0) (USB-C out to ESP32)
- USB to USB-C cable (Battery --> ESP32)

NOTE: The ESP32 family of embedded microcontrollers has many different purchasing options that often use different/incompatible displays, bus connections, peripherals, etc. To avoid confusion, it is highly advisable to purchase the specific ESP32 "flavor" mentioned above for the best compatibility with the provided source code. 

**Software**: 
- Host PC to program target IoT Fox-Node(s)
    - [Arduino IDE ](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Installation & Setup
- Install the [Arduino IDE ](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) on the target "host PC" to build project source code and program ESP32 hardware.
    - ESP32 hardware support package dependencies listed below, install via Arduino IDE GUI "[Board Manager](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/ide-v2-board-manager/)" 
        - [esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) by Espressif Systems <-- main "Arduino-esp32" wrapped software stack
    - Software dependencies libraries shown below, install via Arduino IDE GUI "[Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries/)" outside of the core Arduino-ESP32 software stack.
        - [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) v7.1.0 by Benoit Blanchon
        - [Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library) v1.10.4 by Adafruit (Select "Install All" option to bring in dependencies listed below)
            - Adafruit BusIO v1.16.1            (dependency of Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 installed along side by default.)
            - Adafruit GFX Library v1.11.10     (dependency of Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 installed along side by default.)
            - Adafruit seesaw v1.7.8 Library    (dependency of Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 installed along side by default.)
            - SD v1.3.0 Library                 (dependency of Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 installed along side by default.)

With the IDE setup completed, the "Fox-Node to be" (ESP32 hardware) can now be connected to the host PC via USB and programmed with the provided "Foxclient_HTTP.ino" source code file via Arduino IDE. 

# Usage
The "Fox Hunt" project leverages the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), [Arduino ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) software stack and [ESP32 hardware](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s2-tft-feather/overview) to run a simple HTTP-Client. This client (Foxclient_HTTP.ino), referred to as a "Fox-Node" will auto-connect to the predefined WiFi credentials and beacon an HTTP-POST message every 10 seconds.

NOTE: Target WiFi SSID/PSWD can be easily updated in the source. **Default SSID/PSWD** are both hardcoded as **"UAS6"**.

Fox-Node verification:
The Arduino IDE provides easy access to a serial interface connection (115200 baud) that displays runtime information. This information is also pushed/displayed via an ESP TFT display (unique to the Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather). 

Upon connection to "UAS6" WiFi Network serial output... ex: 

```
WiFi connected
**Fox-Node Initialized**
WiFi Tx Power: 28
IP address: 
192.168.1.2
Attempting POST.
Server connected, Sending POST.
POST success.
STA PWR: 28
HTTP Response code: 200
POST Payload: {"Node_RSSI":-38}
```

If the Fox-Node fails to find the specified WiFi Network... ex:

```
**Fox-Node Initialized**
WiFi Station: 14 Reason: 201
Trying to Reconnect
WiFi Station: 14 Reason: 201
Trying to Reconnect
```

NOTE: not all ESP32 hardware will have a display output. To make this project compatible with such hardware all references to the TFT display can be removed from the source Foxclient_HTTP.ino file to provide more "generic" ESP32 flavor compatibility.

## ESP32 Display

Fox-Node display states:

<Disp. # >, description (background color)

- 3, on sent POST,                   (GREEN)

- 2, no connection to HTTP server,   (Orange)

- 0, TFT init code,                  (Green)

## Branch List 

**main**: 
- UAS 6.0 Stage 2 code (only dummy data + RSSI info from the Fox Node)

**Live_Sensors**: 
- Support for live data via I2C (sending real sensor data as payload via I2C --> ESP --> HTTP-POST)

## Project status
Development targets PSCR - UAS 6.0 First Responder UAS Data Gatherer Challenge
- Working Proof of concept w/ HTTP.POST "Fox-Nodes" w/real-time and dummy data.
